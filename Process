Steps :


Step 1: Set Up the Canvas


Open Photoshop and create a new document. Set the canvas size based
on the desired resolution (e.g., 1920 x 1080 pixels).


Choose an aspect ratio that complements a landscape layout.


Step 2: Background and Sky


Use the Gradient Tool to create a blue gradient from light blue at the
horizon to deep blue at the top for the sky.


Add a warm color gradient (light yellow or pink) near the horizon to
simulate sunrise or sunset.


Step 3: Mountain Creation


Use the Pen Tool or Lasso Tool to outline mountain shapes.


Fill the shapes with blue tones, varying in darkness based on distance
(lighter shades for distant mountains).


Use the Brush Tool with soft edges to add highlights on the mountain
peaks where sunlight would hit.


Step 4: Trees and VegetationAdd foreground trees with tree brushes or by manually painting trunks
and branches with the Brush Tool.


Adjust opacity and layer order to give depth to midground and
background trees.


For grass and flowers, use smaller brushes and add vibrant colors for a
lively scene:


Step 5: River and Reflection


Use the Pen Tool or Brush Tool to draw a river. Apply a blue gradient,
making it lighter where the light hits.
Duplicate the elements near the river (trees, animals) and flip them
vertically. Place them on the water's surface with reduced opacity to
mimic reflection,


Step 6: Adding Animals and Birds


Place animal PNG images along the riverbanks and grass areas.


Use bird brushes to add flying birds in the sky. Vary the size and opacity
to create a realistic effect.


Step 7: Lighting and Sun Rays


Create a light source by adding a soft yellow or orange circle on a new
layer, representing the sun.


Use the Dodge Tool to brighten areas where sunlight would naturally fall
(mountain peaks, treetops).


To add sun rays, use the Polygonal Lasso Tool to select ray shapes and fill
with a light gradient.


Step 8: Final Colour Grading and Adjustments


Apply a Colour Lookup Adjustment Layer to enhance the overall color
tone and mood,


Use Curves or Brightness/Contrast adjustments to fine-tune shadows and


Add a Vignette Effect by darkening the edges of the image for a natural
focus on the center
